# Network Modeling for Bacterial Communities

This repository is part of a summer project with **Dr. Emily Davenport** from **Pennsylvania State University**, where we developed a model to study disease dynamics in individuals. We utilized the **TwinsUK dataset** for this project, which includes 16S sequencing data of bacterial communities.

## Files

### 1. **[SPIEC-EASI.Rmd](./SPIEC-EASI.Rmd)**

This R Markdown file contains the code for generating a **SPIEC-EASI network** for bacterial communities using **16S sequencing data**. It includes a generic workflow that can be used for network construction based on sequencing data.

- **Key Features**:
  - Network generation using SPIEC-EASI (Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference).
  - Designed for 16S sequencing data of bacterial communities.

### 2. **[SPIEC-EASI_statistics.Rmd](./SPIEC-EASI_statistics.Rmd)**

This R Markdown file is still a work in progress. It contains algorithms to calculate and visualize important **network statistics** for the generated SPIEC-EASI network. Key metrics include:
- Modularity
- Transitivity
- Centrality

These statistics help in understanding the structure and relationships within the bacterial communities.

- **Key Features**:
  - Calculates various network statistics.
  - Visualizes key properties such as modularity, transitivity, and centrality.

### 3. **[SPIEC-EASI_network.png](./SPIEC-EASI_network.png)**

This file contains the **network visualization** generated by the SPIEC-EASI modeling technique. It provides a visual representation of the bacterial community network based on the analysis.

- **Key Features**:
  - Visual representation of the bacterial network.
  - Shows connections between various bacterial species based on ecological relationships inferred from the data.
